## Overview

The main objective I had for this project was to learn and use grid since I had never done that before.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process

I started with the grid layout trying to match the design as well as I could and trying to figure out the semantical divs I'd use. After I had the basic layout and the semantical parts sorted I started filling in each part from top to bottom with the html and css, after the Desktop top desing were finished I started working on the mobile version. At the end I did the mobile menu and it's Script. 

### Built with
